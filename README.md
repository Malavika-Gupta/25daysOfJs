# 25 Days of JavaScript - Learning Challenge

Welcome to my **25 Days of JavaScript** Learning Challenge! ðŸš€

In this journey, I focused on mastering the core concepts of JavaScript over the span of 25 days. Each day, I tackled different fundamental aspects of the language, and by the end, I built a **Weather App** using APIs to showcase the skills I gained.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge was designed to help me grasp the key concepts of JavaScript, including:

- Variables and Data Types
- Functions and Scopes
- Arrays and Objects
- Loops and Conditionals
- DOM Manipulation
- ES6 Features (let, const, arrow functions, etc.)
- Promises and Async/Await
- Fetch API

The final project, a **Weather App**, integrates everything I learned by interacting with an API to display real-time weather information.

## Project Structure

- **Day1 - Day23**: Each day contains a dedicated folder with code snippets, small projects, or challenges focusing on specific JavaScript topics.
- **Day24 - Day25**: The final days, where I implemented a **Weather App** using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Weather App

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to:

- Search for a city's weather.
- Display real-time temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Use dynamic background changes based on weather conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the Weather App.
- **JavaScript**: For logic, API calls, and dynamic updates.
- **OpenWeather API**: To fetch real-time weather data.

## Key Takeaways

Throughout this challenge, I:

- Gained a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
- Learned how to interact with APIs.
- Built a fully functional weather app that demonstrates real-world JavaScript usage.
